Waylaid Game my first game project created at my universty.
Its a game created in unity by using c#, animations, logs, audio, background, players, scenes. 
First of all, there's the first scene in my game.There's a player that has a health bar, the technique to attack.
Enemies, there are two types first type that appears on regular levels and they have a weak health bar, second type the monster level he has a strong health bar. 
Also, there are levels each level be harder every time you pass so you need to pass it sequentially till the monster level. 
That's simply how the game works
